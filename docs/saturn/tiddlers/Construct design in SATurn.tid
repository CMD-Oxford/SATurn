title: Construct design in SATurn
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

!Introduction
SATurn has been designed to simplify the type of medium/high throughput plate-based cloning conducted at the [[SGC|https://www.thesgc.org]] which involves creating various different constructs of the same gene with varying: construct boundaries, N/C terminal tags, point mutations, deletions, insertions, and vector combinations with the aim of obtaining protein for use in: crystallization, electron microscopy, biophysical and cell based assays.  SATurn isn't meant to replace tools like [[SnapGene|http://www.snapgene.com/]] or [[VectorNTI|https://www.thermofisher.com/uk/en/home/life-science/cloning/vector-nti-software.html]] but rather to complement these tools by making highly repetitive tasks easier with regards to construct design and downstream analysis and to provide a degree of validation before experiments are conducted.  To put this into context the SGC has designed 165,000 constructs over the period 2004 - 2018.

The basic construct design workflow everybody is familiar with is shown below along with the names we use in SATurn to refer to the various cloning entities.

  </tr>

Note that within the SATurn database: a construct is connected to an allele and vector,  an allele to an entry clone and forward/reverse primers, and an entry clone to a target.  

SATurn allows you to save all of the above cloning entities into it's database which can either be created one-by-one or automatically by using the construct design tool which requires only that you specify the start/end positions of the construct along with the entry clone name and vector to use.
